# Writing Queries With Multiple Solutions

## Preparation

Before proceeding to the tasks, you need to download the database. The database file is in zip format (dvdrental.zip), so you need to extract it to dvdrental.rar. Follow the installation instructions described in the following document (Installation_instructions.docx).

A short description of a database that contains a film table can be found in the documentation (or in the PostgreSQL Sample Database).


This part of the practice section will check your ability to solve a task with the SQL queries written in different ways, as well as your ability to clarify questions with the reviewer. You are expected to provide at least two solutions for each question below.

The task will take you about 3.5 hours.
Please be aware that the task is mandatory.
You can earn a maximum of 42 points for this task.

| Functionality of queries | The queries run with errors, and their content is irrelevant.       | The queries run with errors, but their content is relevant to the task. | The queries run without errors and are in line with the task description.    |
| Accuracy of answer       | The task was not understood, and an irrelevant solution is offered. |                                                                         | The task was understood correctly, and a valid, optimal solution is offered. |
| Variety of solutions     | No solutions are suggested.                                         | Only one non-optimal solution is suggested.                             | Multiple optimal solutions to the problem are suggested.                     |
